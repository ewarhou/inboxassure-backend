## Authentication
For non-authenticated endpoints, you need to provide the following headers:

1. `Cookie`: Authentication token
   - Location: Found in `user_settings` table
   - Field: `instantly_user_token`
   - Format: Raw token value
   - Relationship: Associated with the user's account

2. `X-Org-Auth`: Organization authentication token
   - Location: Found in `user_instantly` table
   - Field: `instantly_organization_token`
   - Format: Raw token value
   - Relationship: Links to the organization(s) the user has access to

## Example Headers
```
Cookie: your_instantly_user_token_here
X-Org-Auth: your_instantly_organization_token_here
```

## Note
- Both headers are required for non-authenticated endpoints
- Tokens must be valid and active
- Missing or invalid tokens will result in authentication errors
- One user can belong to multiple organizations
