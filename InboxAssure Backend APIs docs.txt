# InboxAssure Backend API Documentation

## Spamcheck Queueing System

The InboxAssure backend implements a queueing system for spamchecks to ensure fair resource allocation and prevent any single user from monopolizing the system.

### Spamcheck Status Flow

Spamchecks now follow this status flow:
1. **queued**: Initial status when a spamcheck is created or scheduled
2. **pending**: Ready to be processed by the launcher
3. **in_progress**: Currently being processed
4. **waiting_for_reports**: Emails have been sent, waiting for the specified time before generating reports
5. **generating_reports**: Reports are being generated
6. **completed**: Spamcheck is complete
7. **failed**: Spamcheck failed
8. **paused**: Spamcheck is paused

### Queue Processing

The system processes spamchecks in the queue as follows:
1. For each user, only one spamcheck is processed at a time
2. Only spamchecks scheduled for now or in the past are processed (schedule-aware)
3. Only spamchecks scheduled for the current weekday are processed (if weekdays are specified)
4. The oldest eligible queued spamcheck for each user is selected first
5. When a spamcheck is completed, the next queued spamcheck for that user is processed
6. Spamchecks in 'waiting_for_reports' status don't block other spamchecks from being processed
7. Recurring spamchecks are automatically added back to the queue with 'queued' status

This ensures fair resource allocation and prevents any single user from monopolizing the system while respecting scheduled dates and weekday preferences.

### Weekday Scheduling

The system supports scheduling spamchecks to run only on specific days of the week:

- Weekdays are represented as integers from 0 to 6 (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
- You can specify any combination of weekdays (e.g., [0, 3] for Monday and Thursday)
- Weekday scheduling works alongside the existing scheduling options:
  * `scheduled_at`: When the spamcheck should first run
  * `recurring_days`: How often to repeat the spamcheck
  * `weekdays`: Which days of the week the spamcheck is allowed to run

For example:
- If you set `scheduled_at=2023-05-01` (a Monday), `recurring_days=7`, and `weekdays=[0]` (Monday only), the spamcheck would run every Monday.
- If you set `scheduled_at=2023-05-01`, `recurring_days=3`, and `weekdays=[0,3]` (Monday and Thursday), the spamcheck would run every 3 days, but only if that day is a Monday or Thursday.

### Reports Waiting Time

The system supports configurable waiting times before generating reports after emails are sent:

- When emails are sent, the spamcheck enters the 'waiting_for_reports' status
- The `reports_waiting_time` field determines how long to wait before generating reports
- Available options:
  * `0`: Immediate report generation (no waiting)
  * `0.5`: 30 minutes waiting time
  * `1.0`: 1 hour waiting time (default)
  * `2.0` to `12.0`: 2 to 12 hours waiting time in 1-hour increments

This waiting period allows time for emails to be delivered and processed by email providers before checking their placement, resulting in more accurate deliverability reports.

During this waiting period, users can continue to queue and process other spamchecks, as the 'waiting_for_reports' status doesn't block the queue processing system.
