This command handles recurring spamchecks by:
1. Finding completed spamchecks with recurring_days set (both Instantly and Bison)
2. Immediately:
   - Sets status back to pending
   - Updates scheduled_at to recurring_days after original schedule
   - If weekdays are specified, adjusts to the next available day in the weekdays list
3. Skips failed or paused spamchecks
